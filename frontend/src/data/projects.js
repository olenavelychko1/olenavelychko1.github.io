    description: `A full-stack web application that visualizes election results using responsive Vue components and a Spring Boot backend. I built the frontend with reusable, mobile-friendly components and implemented the backend with RESTful APIs for constituencies and results. I parsed a part of the official XML election data, mapped it into Java models, designed part of the database, and wrote unit tests. I'm currently expanding the platform with an admin dashboard to manage user actions on the forum and adding security features.`

    description: `A web-based game webshop built with TypeScript, Express, MySQL, and modern frontend tooling. I implemented the game details page, review functionality, and navbar, matching Figma design closely. I connected an open-source translation API via Docker to enable multilingual support and deployed it to make the site accessible in multiple languages. The game details page dynamically pulls data from the database, providing users with up-to-date product and review information. I also set up unit tests using Vitest to ensure code reliability and maintainability, with the use of Postman`

              A web-based game called "The Lost City of Azarath," built with TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Express.
              This has been a huge passion project for me and my team — in fact, it was my favorite project throughout
              the entire study.
              We learned a lot about game development during this period and faced challenges that pushed our skills,
              but in the end we won a school award for "The Most Complete Experience" and were one of the most liked
              games in the first-year classes.
              <br />
              I personally contributed by developing the reading component, creating the dynamic sound system that
              changes room music and ambient sounds,
              implementing the arrow navigation component, designing around 60% of the UI, building most of the game
              rooms,
              and acting as the main bug fixer for the team. This project helped me significantly improve my TypeScript
              and HTML skills,
              strengthened my problem-solving abilities, and deepened my passion for game development.
